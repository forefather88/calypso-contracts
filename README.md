# Here is my guide on deploying our upgradable smart contracts with truffle.

Preparation:
1. Install truffle compiler with npm "install -g truffle" command;
2. Go to https://infura.io/dashboard/ethereum and generate an API key for Kovan network;
3. In truffle-config.js file input your endpoint "wss://kovan.infura.io/ws/v3/your_api_key"
4. Generate an API Key on your Etherscan account on https://etherscan.io/apis;
5. In the root folder create ".env" file with "KOVANAPI = 'YOUR_API_KEY'" line (this one will be needed for verifying SC on the Etherscan);
6. In the root folder create "metamask.txt" file and print your metamask account mnemonic;

Deploying and upgrading:
1. Read carefully how to write and make changes in upgradable SC's on https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/;
2. Make changes in a smart contract;
3. Put the migration file in the migrations folder. Always keep 1_initial_migration.js in migrations folder and make sure that it will be the first file by name;
4. I suggest deploying and upgrading SC's one by one, so the migrations of SC's that won't be deployed or upgraded should be stored in NO_DEPLOY folder;
5. If you are deploying an SC, uncomment Deploy section in a migration file and comment Upgrade section. If you are upgrading - do the opposite;
6. Make sure that the build folder is deleted, for some reason it won't work if the folder exists. SC's will be re-compiled in any case;
7. Run "npx truffle migrate --network kovan" command in a terminal. After after upgrading the contract it's address won't be changed!

After deploying please follow these instructions:
1. After deploying Oracle change CAL, USDT, Operator and link aggregator addresses
2. Change Oracle address and deploy CalSwap, poolManager, testFaucet, staking, escrow, affiliate
3. Change Escrow, staking, affiliate address in Oracle
4. Send CAL to CalSwap, Escrow
5. Send USDT to testFaucet
